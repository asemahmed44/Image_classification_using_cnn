# Image_classification_using_cnn
Built a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras to classify CIFAR-10 images. Preprocessed and normalized data, visualized samples, and designed a multi-layer model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers. Trained for 10 epochs and achieved 70% test accuracy, demonstrating solid image classification performance.
